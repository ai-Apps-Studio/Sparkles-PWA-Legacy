# Sparkles PWA (Portfolio Archive)

This repository contains the source code for the original **Sparky App**, a "Lite" creative suite powered by Generative AI. This project served as the foundational prototype and validated the core concepts that later evolved into the more complex **[Montestory Ecosystem](https://github.com/ai-Apps-Studio/Montestory)**.

**Status:** This project is **archived** and is no longer in active development. It is preserved here for portfolio and historical purposes.
